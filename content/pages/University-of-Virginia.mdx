              ## The History of the University


              In 1818, twenty-four commissioners met to choose the location of
              the first public university in Virginia, an institution that they
              believed would “form statesmen, legislators and judges, on whom
              public prosperity and individual happiness are so much to depend.”
              They imagined the new school would “develop the reasoning
              faculties of our youth, enlarge their minds, cultivate their
              morals, and instill into them the precepts of virtue and order; To
              enlighten them with mathematical and physical sciences, which
              advance the arts, and administer to the health, the subsistence,
              and comforts of human life; And, generally, to form them to habits
              of reflection and correct action, rendering them examples of
              virtue to others, and of happiness within themselves. These are
              the objects of that higher grade of education.” 


              The school was officially chartered by the state legislature as
              the University of Virginia in 1819 and opened its doors to
              instruction in 1825. It has admitted students continuously since
              then. By the onset of the Civil War, UVA had become one of the
              three largest universities in America. By the mid-1870s,
              approximately 9,000 students from across the United States had
              attended UVA. Many went on to become prominent legislators,
              lawyers, judges, doctors, businessmen, and professors.
