              The Republic of Colleges represents a remarkable collaboration
              between scholars representing several institutions. All have
              worked to scan documents, share data, contribute interpretive
              materials, and work together to create ever more detailed
              histories highlighting the educational networks comprising the
              Republic of Colleges. This digital history project chronicles both
              educational networks in the early Republic as well as the people
              who built, sustained, and expanded them. Have questions, comments,
              or an interest in joining the collaborative effort?
