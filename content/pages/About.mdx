              ## The Birth of the Republic of Colleges


              This project grew first out of work conducted at the University of
              Virginia. Since 2012, a series of research projects were launched:
              a 2012 digital project on the founding and development of UVA in
              its first sixty years and also two university research and
              education projects examining slavery and segregation in the
              school’s history. Together, they have provided data for the
              ongoing Jefferson’s University-The Early Life Project, which is
              creating a thickly descriptive and deeply sourced history of the
              early university. It quickly became apparent that UVA was embedded
              in a dense network of exchange linking schools across both the
              state and the country: UVA students did graduate work at other
              schools, became professors and administrators elsewhere, became
              leaders in politics, education, medicine, and the law all across
              America. This project, now a collaboration of inclusive history
              projects largely stemming from Universities Studying Slavery (USS)
              member institutions, seeks to map the people who moved from school
              to school and state to state, frequently stepping into leadership
              positions across the young republic, and thereby trace the
              movement of people and ideas.

              ## Which Schools Comprise the Republic of Colleges?


              Any school founded between 1636 and 1860 can be included in this
              project. To date, the project has collected existing scanned or
              digitized college and university catalogs in the public domain
              that list students, faculty, administrators, and graduates. It has
              also primarily focused on schools who are members of the
              Universities Studying Slavery (USS) Consortium that have launched
              substantive research projects regarding pre-1880 institutional
              histories and thus can contribute additional documentary data to
              this project. The work here is ongoing. We welcome and encourage
              contributions of documentary scans and interpretive material from
              any college or university that was open and operating before 1860.

              ###### The Republic of Colleges was created by Kirt von Daacke,
              professor of history and American Studies at the University of
              Virginia, and Ashley Schmidt, Ph.D., historian and UVA Gibbons
              Project Assistant Director.

              ## Expanding the Republic of Colleges


              As this project grows, we will continue to add archival materials
              documenting the students, faculty, and administrators at early
              American colleges, as well as materials providing additional
              biographical details about them. The list of included schools will
              expand, and the data regarding each school will also expand as new
              schools collaborate on the project.
